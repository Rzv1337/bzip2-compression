# Installation

To set up the compression script, please follow these steps:

1.Create a new folder and place the following files inside it: 7compress.bat, 7za.dll and 7za.exe.

2.Move the files you wish to compress with bzip2 into the same folder where you saved the files from step 1.

3.Open the 7compress.bat file.

Once the script completes its execution, all the files in the folder, along with any subdirectories, will be compressed using the bzip2 algorithm.
